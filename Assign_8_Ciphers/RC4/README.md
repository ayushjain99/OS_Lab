# rc4
Implementation of the stream cipher - RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)

`From Wikipedia`
> The RC4 Encryption Algorithm, developed by Ronald Rivest of RSA, is a shared key stream cipher algorithm requiring a secure exchange of a shared key. The symmetric key algorithm is used identically for encryption and decryption such that the data stream is simply XORed with the generated key sequence.
